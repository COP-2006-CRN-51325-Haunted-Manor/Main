These files contain the code for the Haunted Mansion text based adventure. Each room of the Mansion (the kitchen, stairwell, dining room, living room, basement and music room) is separated.
There is a file called test build that has all of the sections together. It requires C++ and some sort of website or program that can run a C++ program (like Clion).

The game:
You go into a haunted mansion and are locked in. The only way out is to gather music notes from around the rooms. You have to put the correct order in the piano (in the music room) and you get a key.
Each room has it's own puzzle and or secrets and you have to discover it.
